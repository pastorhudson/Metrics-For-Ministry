# Privacy Policy

Privacy is important to us all in today's world. This is an intense outline of the privacy policy here. We know that this outline might be overkill, it's purely intended to cover our bases and provide additional information for users. If you ever have questions, don't hesitate to email us at hello@savvytoolbelt.com.

This is independently designed and managed and is in no way affiliated with Planning Center Online \(PCO\).

One important note about our product and privacy. We are the middle man between your data on PCO and Google. This is important to realize because by utilizing our product you have agreed to both privacy policies and we are completely unaffiliated with both companies. We are simply a pass-through tool where no personal or financial data is stored, managed, or shared outside of your Google document. The only data we collect is through signing up to Mailchimp for updates or through Google Analytics to get an understanding of who/how/when our product is used.

## Personal Information We Collect

When you visit https://metricsforministry.com \(the “Site”\), we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”

We collect Device Information using the following technologies:

* “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).
* “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
* “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the Site. Additionally, when you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase through the Site, we collect certain information from you, including your payment information, and email address. Your payment information is stored by Stripe, and we store your email address.

When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Order Information.

## Google Privacy:

A part of our integration we request very specific permissions from you, these are called scopes. We have tried to minimize this the best possible. Below we outline all the scopes that we have requested.

### User Data:

We request your email address as outlined below. This is requested to be used within the Metrics for Ministry plugin only and will not be shared or stored externally.

We request this information in order to provide support and product improvements internally.

| Scope | Reason |
| :--- | :--- |
| _./auth/userinfo.email_ | This is your email address. We use this to understand who is using our product and provide support. |
| _./auth/datastudio.readonly_ | This is a part of our Data Studio Connectors. This allows us to read existing connectors through the API. |
| _./auth/datastudio_ | This allows us to create new Data Studio Connectors. We never do this on our own, you create each connector. |
| _./auth/drive.file_ | This gives us access to the Google Sheet file where you've installed Metrics for Ministry. This is used exclusively to write to the file and update the information. |
| _./auth/spreadsheets_ | This allows us to execute a daily sync to PCO without your input, alongside bringing the data into Google Data Studio. |
| _./auth/script.container.ui_ | _Sidebars are how this app operates. This gives us the ability to operate and show a sidebar._ |
| _./auth/script.external\_request_ | _Planning Center requires you to log in. This gives us permission to open a new page with the login._ |
|  | \_\_ |

## How Do We Use Your Personal Information?

We use the Personal Information that we collect to:

* Communicate with you.
* When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or advertising relating to our products or services.

We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud \(in particular, your IP address\), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site \(for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns\).

## Sharing Your Personal Information

We share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your Personal Information, as described above.

We use the following tools:

**Google Analytics**  
We use Google Analytics to help us understand how our customers use the Site - you can read more about how Google uses your Personal Information here: [https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/). You can also opt-out of Google Analytics here: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

**Google Sheets**  
The Google Sheets Add-On operates primarily within Google Sheets itself to download and store your data. Google Sheets access is controlled solely by the other of the document and no one else. We do not currently store any data from you here outside of Google Analytics.

**PCO \(Planning Center Online\).**  
The Google Sheets Add-On “PCO to Google Integration” connects to PCO via their API. We use the PCO API to retrieve your church data so that you can insert it into your Google Sheets and subsequently into Google Data Studio. Other than what you choose to store in a document, we do not store any emails, names or, other information from PCO. Data obtained through the PCO API will not unknowingly be passed to any third-party.

**GDS \(Google Data Studio\).**  
The Google Data Studio connector connects your Google Sheets data to GDS in order to provide data analytics and insights to your organization. We utilize Google Scripts to make this possible. At no point in this process do we collect any information about the data or your organization outside of log files that help us identify and resolve bugs in the platform.

Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.
