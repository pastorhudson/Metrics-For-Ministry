# FAQ

## What modules do you currently support?

Currently, we support the Planning Center People module with plans to expand to additional modules.

## Can I use this without Google Data Studio \(GDS\)?

Yes. This integration brings your data into Google Sheets and if you're more comfortable creating charts and metrics within sheets, we encourage you to do so! However, in our experience, GDS might have a learning curve but becomes an incredibly scalable solution when it comes to sharing your numbers and data without having to share a whole spreadsheet.

## How much does this cost?

We use Google Sheets, Google Data Studio, and Planning Center for this integration. All the Google products come free with your Google account and should not charge you anything. Planning Center also has a free tier and for more information, you can go [here](https://www.planningcenter.com/).

## What if I want to add PCO modules after I've already set this up?

You can add modules at any time by simply following the steps below:

1. Back on your Google Sheet click **Add-ons** &gt; **Metrics for Ministry** &gt; **Sidebar.**
2. Click **Settings** 
3. Select the **ALL** modules you want to sync and click **Authorize with PCO.**
4. This will prompt you to now login with Planning Center.
5. Click the **Back** button and then click **Update Sheets**
   * This update process can take 1 minute - 5 minutes to complete based on the size of your church database.
