# Metrics for Ministry

 

![](.gitbook/assets/savvy-128x128.png)

This integration is built and maintained by Savvy Tool Belt and is not connected with Planning Center Online in any way.

## Purpose

Tracking numbers is hard, and it's even harder when you have to manually update CSV files, download information, and create your own metrics. The goal of the PCO to Google integration is to remove the additional work involved in understanding the health of your church along with created an automated and sharable solution.

## **Requirements**

* You are required to be a Planning Center Admin for the modules that you're attempting to connect to.
* You must have a Google Account \(You can get this free\).
* This is **not** designed for extremely large churches. Google has a data cap at the moment. If you fall in this category and want to utilize Metrics for Ministry email us at [hello@savvytoolbelt.com](mailto:hello@savvytoolbelt.com)
